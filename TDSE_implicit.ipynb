    "# Time-dependent S.E., matrix formulation\n",

    "Here we develop a different approach, which will lead us to an *implicit* algorithm: The thing on the L.H.S that we want is also on the R.H.S, and can't just be moved over. (You'll see what I mean when I get there.) \n",

    "Recall that we can write the formal solution to the time-dependent Schroedinger equation by evolving the wave function in time with the Hamiltonian as follows:\n",

    "Hey! We just solved all of quantum mechanics! (**Question:** why is this not true?)\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why this not terribly useful is that $H$ is an *operator.* To see why this complicates life (and physics), let's rewrite the L.H.S. of Eq. 1 as a Taylor series:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\exp\\left(-it\\hat{H}/\\hbar\\right)\\psi = \\left(1-\\frac{it}{\\hbar}\\hat{H} - \\frac{t^2}{2\\hbar^2}\\hat{H}^2 + \\cdots \\right)\\psi \\tag{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The difficulty is that $\\hat{H}^2$ means \"apply $H$ twice in a row.\" Let's see how this works by writing it out explicitly, substituting for $\\hat{H}$:\n",

    "\n",
    "Applying $V$ to $\\psi$, then the derivative is *different* than applying the derivative, then $V$, because in general they do not commute! Operators make life difficult. It gets worse when you start going to higher order terms in Eq. 2. A lot worse. And where do you stop?\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe we can make progress by taking $\\Delta t$ to be very small. We are in search of a numerical method after all, and we can make the timestep as small as we like. Then the wavefunction at $t+\\Delta t$ can be found from $t$ formally by\n",

    "## Problem #1: Stability\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a linear expansion, and (just like our Euler scheme that we tried last time) it is unstable. The reason is that our timestep $\\Delta t$ appears in the exponential...so no matter what we do, the error grows without bound. A minor looking modification, however, makes it stable. Instead of propagating forward in time with $\\exp(-i\\Delta t \\hat{H}/\\hbar)$, we go backwards in time by replacing $\\Delta t$ with $-\\Delta t$. (Rather than predicting, we are correcting, sort of.) If you feel like we got something for free, you will soon see that we did not!\n",

    "The discretized version of this equation looks as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "Compare Eqs 6 and 8: In order to update the value of the wavefunction at grid point $n$ at time $t_{i+1}$, you need the value of the wavefunction at grid points $n-1$ and $n+1$...*also at the same time $t_{n+1}$.* At first glance that seems ludicrous, but recognize that the R.H.S. can be expressed as a matrix equation: At a given time $t_{n+1}$, our discretized wavefunction is a vector (with a number of elements equal to the number of grid points.) The thing that multiplies it is a discretized version of the Hamiltonian, i.e., a matrix. So we could use this expression to solve our problem...but first we have to *invert* the matrix on the R.H.S., move it over to the left, and voila. This is called an *implicit* algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem #2: Unitarity\n",
    "\n",
    "But wait! It gets worse. Neither Eq. 6 or Eq. 8 preserves Unitarity. The reason is the truncation of the Taylor series at the linear term: $\\exp[-i\\Delta t\\hat{H}/\\hbar]$ is a Unitary operator, $1 - i\\Delta t \\hat{H}/\\hbar$ is not. This problem is rectified by using the *Cayley form* to approximate the exponential: \n",

    "\n",
    "Very roughly speaking, when we made the simpler linear approximations forward and backward in time (Eqs 5 and 7), we screwed up the symmetry of the time-evolution operator that is responsible for Unitarity, and by using the Cayley form we restore it. To obtain the implicit algorithm from here, apply the Cayley for of the (approximate) time-evolution operator, move the denominator to the LHS, then discretize:\n",
