    "## Solving the Schroedinger Equation, Old Skool\n",
    "\n",
    "The Schroedinger equation (S.E. hereafter for short) is a PDE, which makes life difficult. The general approach to attempt an exact solution (which is not possible in most cases!) is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Separate the variables (time and space).\n",
    "2. Solve each part separately.\n",
    "3. Impose boundary conditions to find the (quantized) stationary states.\n",
    "4. The solution for any initial condition is expressed as a sum of stationary states.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we will go through these steps formally, then apply them to a classic problem --- the particle in a box.\n",

    "Then substitute our ansatz into the S.E.:\n",

    "$$\\begin{align}\n",

    "i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left[ R(\\mathbf{r})T(t)\\right ] &= \\frac{-\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla^2 \\left[R(\\mathbf{r})T(t)\\right ] + V(\\mathbf{r})\\left [R(\\mathbf{r})T(t)\\right ] \\tag{Eq. 3}\\\\\n",

    "### Time Dependence\n",
    "Now we note that the L.H.S. of Eq. 5 is a function of $t$ only and the R.H.S. is only a function of $r$. That means they must both be equal to the same constant. Let's call it $E$ (foreshadowing for what lies ahead). We can immediately integrate the L.H.S.:\n",

    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spatial Dependence\n",
    "Aha! The time dependence of $\\psi$ is only a function of $E$. Now let's look at the spatial dependence. Returning to Eq. 5, but now looking at the R.H.S. (remember: both sides of Eq. 5 must equal the same constant, which we called \"$E$\").\n",

    "Note that since we have separated the spatial and time dependence in $\\psi$, and since $\\hat{H}$ only depends on the spatial variables, we can also write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{H}\\psi = E\\psi \\tag{Eq. 9}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a matrix equation: The matrix $\\hat{H}$ multiplies a vector $\\psi$, and returns a scalar $E$ times the same vector $\\psi$. In other words, $E$ is an eigenvalue of $\\hat{H}$ and $\\psi$ is the corresponding eigenvector, as is the purely spatial part of the eigenvector $R$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because there is no time-dependence in Eq. 7, the eigenvectors $R$ represent *stationary states* of $\\hat{H}$. They are discrete, and we will index them by an (integer) quantum number $\\ell$:\n",

    "\n",
    "The stationary states and eigenvalues are determined by the boundary conditions and the potential $V$. (I'll remind you of how this works in an example below.)\n",
    "\n",
    "What about the full time dependent solution? As usual when solving for the time dependent solution of a differential equation we need an initial condition: $\\psi(r,t=0)$. Because the eigenvectors form a complete basis, we can write the initial condition as a sum of the eigenvectors, wirth appropriately chosen amplitudes $A_{\\ell}$:\n",

    "This is a projection, just like the projection of the dynamics of a system of coupled oscillators onto the normal modes. In this case, however, the eigenstates that form a basis for the preojection need not be sines and cosines â€” they are determined by the BC and potential. So if $V$ is the infinite well, you get cosines for $R_{\\ell}$; if $V$ is the harmonic oscillator you get Hermite polynomials, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Full Solution\n",
    "Since the solution is separable and we have already obtained the time-dependent solution, we can immediately write down a formal solution for $\\psi$ at any time $t$:\n",

    "### Projection and Orthonormality\n",
    "\n",
    "The amplitudes $A_{\\ell}$ are determined using the orthonormal property of the basis, just like you would do when determining discrete Fourier coefficients, or normal mode amplitudes, or in any other problem in which the solution is expressed in the form of Eq. 11. Orthonormality means\n",

    "We can use this property to derive an expression for the amplitudes $A_{\\ell}$ by starting with our expression for $\\psi{r,t=0}$ in Eq. 11, then multiplying through by $R_n$ and then integrating to project onto the basis:\n",
