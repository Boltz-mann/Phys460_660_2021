    "## Numerical integration of differential equations\n",
    "\n",
    "In physics, we encounter many, many phenomena which are described by differential equations. A couple examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t) = \\left[ \\frac{-\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla^2 + V(\\mathbf{r},t)\\right]\\Psi (\\mathbf{r},t) \\\\ \n",
    "-\\frac{dV}{dx} = m\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So therefore we had better think about how to solve differential equations in the computer. We will see many different algorithms for this purpose, which one is appropriate will depend on the nature of the diff eq --- degree, partial or ordinary, linear or nonlinear, etc. Let's start with a simple (maybe the simplest) case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unstable nuclei ($^{235}U$, e.g.) have a fixed, random probability per unit time to decay into daughter products. This means that over time, an initial number of $^{235}U$ nuclei ($N_0$) in a sample will decrease according to a simple differential equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dN}{dt} = -\\frac{N(t)}{\\tau} \\tag{1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy to show (just integrate each side) that the solution is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$N(t) = N_0e^{-t/\\tau} \\tag{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we set $t=\\tau$ we find that $N(t=\\tau)/N_0 = e^{-1}$ --- in other words, after a time $\\tau$ has elapsed, the initial number of radioactive nuclei has decreased by a bit less than a factor of 3. For $^{235}U$, $\\tau \\approx 10^9$ years.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Euler algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is silly to use a computer to integrate such an equation, it is a useful warm-up exercise, and it will introduce us to some of the basic features of numerical integration. And since we know the solution in advance, it is easy to check whether our algorithm works (and also get us thinking about what we mean by \"works.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest thing we can do is write down a Taylor series for the number of nuclei at time $t+\\Delta t$, given the number of particles at time $t$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$N(t+\\Delta t) \\approx N(t) + \\left. \\frac{dN}{dt^{\\prime}}\\right | _t \\Delta t + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, this is an *approximation* which drops terms of order $\\Delta t^2$ and higher. The quality of the approximation is therefore controlled by the size of $\\Delta t$, called the discretization, or (in this case) a timestep. (Although it isn't always the case that making the discretization smaller will improve accuracy --- **WHY NOT?**)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the solution depends on first finding the solution at the previous time. We therefore need to start somewhere --- we need to provide an *initial value.* We also need to know the value of the derivative, which in this problem is given by the physics. Our algorithm (called the \"Euler\" method) looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$N(t+\\Delta t) \\approx N(t) - \\frac{N(t)}{\\tau}\\Delta t \\tag{3}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps that need to be executed are therefore:\n",
    "1. Initialize the value of $N(t=0)$\n",
    "2. Use Eq. 3 to find $N(\\Delta t)$\n",
    "3. Repeat step 2 for a total of n integration steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this produces a sequence of pairs of values: $(t_1, N_1), (t_2, N_2),..., (t_n, N_n)$. We will implement this in code and compare to the analytic solution, but first let's talk about non-dimensionalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dimensionless units\n",
    "\n",
    "The time constant for $^{235}U$ decay is $10^9$ years. Does it make sense to multiply over and over again by $10^-9$ in step 2 of our algorithm? Although the likelihood of a floating point error is small in this particular case, this won't always be true. We can avoid some errors of this type by re-writing equations in dimensionless units. As a bonus, we then obtain a solution for any radioactive decay, whether the time constant is $10^9$ years or 1 sec.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's define some timescale, call it $t_0$, (we don't know what it is yet, but it will pop out at the end), and measure time in these units by defining a dimensionless time $\\bar{t}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\bar{t} = t/t_0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now rewrite Eq. 1 in terms of $\\bar{t}$. To do this, note that \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{d}{dt} = \\frac{d}{d\\bar{t}}\\frac{d\\bar{t}}{dt}= \\frac{1}{t_0}\\frac{d}{d\\bar{t}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With this, Eq. 1 becomes \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{1}{t_0}\\frac{dN}{d\\bar{t}} = -\\frac{N}{\\tau}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now multiply through by $t_0$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dN}{d\\bar{t}} = -\\frac{N}{\\tau/t_0}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So our nondimensionalization procedure defines for us a new, *dimensionless* decay constant:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\bar{\\tau} = \\tau/t_0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Without loss of generality, we set $\\bar{\\tau} = 1$, which means that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$t_0 = \\tau$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and our nondimensionalized equation becomes simply\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dN}{d\\bar{t}} = - N$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Euler algorithm for the nondimensionalized case is then\n",
    "\n",
    "$$N(t+\\Delta t) \\approx N(t) - N(t)\\Delta t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It may seem silly to go through all this nonsense for such a simple ODE, but later we will use the same procedure on a more complex example.\n",
