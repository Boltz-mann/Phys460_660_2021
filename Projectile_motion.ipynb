    "The first term is the \"Stokes's Law\" result. (or is it Stokes'? The guy's name was Stokes, not Stoke. I guess it's like Green's function, and so it should be Stokes's.) This term dominates in low Reynolds number fluids, but for a low density, high Reynolds number fluid like air, the $v^2$ term dominates. \n",
    "\n",
    "$B_2$ can not be computed analytically, but we can obtain a reasonable approximation through our intuition about the problem. Consider an object (cannonball, skydiver) of cross section $A$ moving through an atmosphere of density $\\rho$ with velocity $v$. The air molecules of mass $m$ collide with you and thus each acquires a kinetice energy $\\text{KE} \\approx \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$. (This is like the basketball/superball elastic collision problem.)\n",
    "\n",
    "As the object moves a linear distance $\\ell$ through the air, the work done by the air on the falling object is therefore $\\text{KE} = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho A \\ell v^2$. And since that work was performed over the linear distance $\\ell$, the drag force is $F_{drag}=\\text{Work}/\\ell$: $$F_{drag} = \\frac{1}{2}C\\rho A v^2$$ where we have introduced an empirical constant C (a.k.a fudge factor) to account for the effects that we left out. (Aerodynamics, etc.) \n",
