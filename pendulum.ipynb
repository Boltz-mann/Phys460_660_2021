    "# Oscillations, Real Pendulums, and Chaos\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we consider numerical solutions to the motion of a pendulum, which has two important differences compared to projectile motion. First, we will see that the inaccuracies that are inherent to an approximate scheme like the Euler method can render the solution to oscillatory problems *unstable* --- small errors accumulate in our solution. Second, when we consider real pendulums with dissipation and driving forces, we encounter the possibility of chaos --- an important feature in the study of real dynamical systems, which is quite difficult to study without computational approaches.\n",

    "Consider a simple pendulum as shown in the figure: ![pendulum](./pendulum.png) \n",
    "For now, the only two forces acting on the pendulum are gravity and the tension in the string. As I am sure John Morgan has told you, it is convenient to work in a coordinate system with one axis along the string and the other perpendicular. In this system, the only net force is perpendicular to the string, labeled $F_\\theta$ in the figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F_\\theta = -mg\\text{sin}\\theta$$\n",

    "with the natural frequency given by $\\omega_0 = \\sqrt{g/\\ell}$. Because there is no friction, this pendulum (which only exists in physics textbooks!) keeps going with the same amplitude and frequency forever. \n",

For smaller values of $F_D$, $\\Delta\\theta \\rightarrow 0$ with increasing time. On the other hand, $\\Delta\\theta$ diverges with time for larger values of $F_D$. Notice that in both cases the dependence of $\\Delta\\theta$ on $t$ looks to be *exponential* — when we plot it with a logarithmic scale in y, $\\Delta\\theta$ follows a striaght line (on average). \n",

The exponent that appears in the fit to an exponential is called the Lyapunov exponent, denoted $\\lambda$, and it tells us how sensitively the system depends on its initial conditions. Positive $\\lambda$, and the trajectory will diverge exponentially from a nearby one — this is the chaotic regime. Larger positive $\\lambda$, faster divergence. If $\\lambda < 0$, however, the systems settles down to a steady oscillation at the frequency of the driving force. $\\lambda = 0$ therefore separates the stable and unstable regimes.\n",

    "Aha! We see that there are indeed nearly stable orbits hidden within the mess of the phase plot. By only selecting points that are in phase with the driving force, we are doing something like watching a ceiling fan illuminated by a strobe light. If the frequency of the strobe and the fan are equal, the fan appears to stand still, even though it is moving, because every time you observe it it, it happens to be in the same location. The object that we obtain by selecting the phase space points that correspond to the driving frequency is called a \"Poincare section.\"\n",
