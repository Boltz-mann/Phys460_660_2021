    "# Verlet for a chain of coupled nonlinear springs\n",

    "We wrote the equations of motion in terms of the displacement of each mass from its equilibrium position. If we set the spring constants to be equal then for a simple Hookean spring with \n",

    "\n",
    "$$F_j = dx_{j+1} - 2dx_j + dx_{j-1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we make the springs nonlinear, adding a cubic term to the force with force constant $\\beta$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F = -k\\Delta x - \\beta (\\Delta x^3)$$\n",

    "$$F_j = dx_{j+1} - 2dx_j + dx_{j-1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our code has three main steps:\n",
    "1. Set the initial position of one (or more) of the masses perturbed from its equilibrium position.\n",
    "2. Perform one integratiom step with Euler-Cromer.\n",
    "3. Perform N integration steps with Verlet, using the force above\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that (much like in TDSE leapfrog code), we have a loop over the masses inside the Verlet integration loop.\n",
