    "Nearly all scientific computations require *storing* and *operating* on numbers. Consider the deceptively simple task of adding two numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$8 + 4 = 12$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This requires:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. storing \"8\" and \"4\" in some kind of memory\n",
    "2. performing the addition operation\n",
    "3. storing the result \"12\" in memory\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have heard that digital computers store numbers in a \"binary\" representation. What does that mean? \n",
    "\n",
    "We are used to a \"decimal,\" or base 10 system. That means that we have 10 different symbols at our disposal. So if we have 3 positions to record those symbols, we can represent integers from 0 through 999:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$000,001,002,003,...,998,999$$\n",
    "\n",
    "but in *binary* we only have two symbols, 0 and 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$000, 001, 010,011,...,111$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Each position in a binary number represents a power of 2 (and each position in a decimal number represents a power of 10). For example (the subscripts indicate in which base the number is represented):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$101_2 = [1x2^2] + [0x2^1] + [1x2^0] = 4+1 = 5_{10}$$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Question:** What is the largest number than can represented with three binary digits?\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "--> Aha! The range of numbers representable in binary is set by the number of positions (how many zeroes and ones) we set aside in memory to store the number. Each of those digit is called a \"bit.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** What do 32-bit and 64-bit architectures refer to? (Back when I was your age, we had 8 bit video games, and we didn't complain ;0)\n",

    "\n",
    "**Negative numbers.** How do we represent negative numbers? Add another bit for the sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real numbers.** Now we add some digits for *negative* powers of 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$101001_2 = (-1)^1\\times [(0\\times2^2) + (1\\times2^1) + (0\\times2^0) + (0\\times2^{(-1)}) + (1\\times2^{(-2)})] = -2.25_{10}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Can we represnt -2.3 exactly in our 6-bit binary representation? \n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "No! In the computer, it gets mapped to one of the two closest *representable* numbers. Thus, every finite precision binary corresponds to an (infinite) *interval* of real numbers! That means that in the computer you aren't actually adding numbers, you are adding intervals. (Note that this occurs in any base. See, e.g., 1/3 in base 10.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Various data types are available in the computer (integer, long integer, single precision float, double precision float, etc.) For example, the single precision float has one bit for the sign, 8 bits for the exponent, and 23 bits for the fraction:\n",

    "(image from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-precision_floating-point_format) Let's take a look at some of the consequences of finite precision with a few simple lines of Python. First let's have a look at how the limnited range of representable numbers can manifest. On easy way is to add a big number and a small one:\n",
