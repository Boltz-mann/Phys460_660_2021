    "1. It actually works. Sometimes you will hear this sort of thing called \"numerical quadrature,\" a name which derives from the Pythagoreans. They determined areas by constructing squares with the same area as the shape, hence the name. Now it just means integrating.\n",
    "2. If we use more points, our estimate gets better. This is our first encounter with \"sampling errors,\" which arise from the finite-ness of sampling in a problem like this. If we were to generate many area estimates from $N=100$, they would scatter around the true area --- there is a *statistical uncertainty* associated with our estimate.\n",
    "3. We could also have a *systematic error.* What if we used a crappy random number generator, which tended to generate real numbers closer to 1 than 0? Is there any evidence for systematic error in our area calculation above?\n",
    "4. The MC method can be used to generate samples from *any* distribution. In effect, we have transformed an i.i.d. set of random numbers from 0 to 1 into a set that is contained within a circle...but we could use something besides `if (x^2 + y^2) < 1.0` to decide which ones to keep. Usually it is better to use an analytical transformation if one exists (this is how Python generates random numbers from a Gaussian, or weibull, etc), because we don't get to use any of the orange points. \n",

Recall that in stat mech and thermo we spend a lot of time talking about *microstates* and *configurations.* By that we mean the specification of the exact state of a thermodynamic system: What are the exact positions and locations of every atom in an ideal gas? In which direction is every single spin in a paramagnet pointing? Then, given a Hamiltonian, we can (try to) say something about the macrostate (thermodynamics: PV=NkT, e.g.) by summing over all the possible microstates. In case you forgot how this works, let's look at a specific case, and also recall the *Ising model.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Configurations of the Ising model\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ising model is a simple stat mech model for magnetic materials. Imagine partitioning a material into small (nanoscopic) domains, and let each domain have associated with it a magnetic spin. This spin may arise from electronic degrees of freedom, or nuclear ones, or both. If all (or most) the spins point in the same direction the material obtains an overall magnetic moment. In the Ising model we only permit up and down orientations of the spins, and we arrange them on a lattice:\n",

    "\n",
    "Are there some configurations that are more likely than others? If the system is *isolated,* the answer is No! This is the *assumption of equal a priori probabilities* on which all of stat mech is built. \n",
    "\n",
    "But if we ask instead \"How many microstates correspond to $N/2$ spins up?,\" the answer is \"a lot\" when N is large. However, if instead we ask \"how many states correspond are there with all spins up?,\" the answer is $1$. This difference is the microscopic basis of entropy --- the first case has a higher entropy, because there are more ways of doing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ising model observables.** What kinds of things might we measure in a simulation of an Ising model? Where are the links between the microscopic degrees of freedom and the macroscopic thermodynamic observables? \n",

Physically, it is like the \"strength\" of a bar magnet that corresponds to the particular microscopic arrangment of spins. Later, we will define several other important observables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Averages.** A single configuration doesn't mean much to the macroscopic thermodynamics, since during the time that a typical measurement takes the system will sample many, many microscopic states.

However, instead of generating points in the plane at random, we will generate *microscopic configurations* at random. For the paramagnet (no external field, so every spin is equally likely to be up or down), it is easy to do. For each spin, just pick a random number between 0 and 1. If the rand is less than 0.5, set the spin to \"up.\" If it is more than 0.5, set the spin to \"down.\" Once you have done this for every spin, then you have generated a microscopic configuration of the paramagnet. Then do that a bunch of times (for \"totMCS\" in the pseudo code below) and you have generated a bunch of comnfigurations, and you can start taking averages and computing thermodynamic quantities.   \n",

I will use the code above to generate configurations of a paramagnet in the absence of any external field, and I will keep a tally on how many times we find configurations with $N/2$ spins up, $N/2 - 1$ spins up, and so on. With a total number of spins $N$ and with $n$ of the spins up, we define the *multiplicity* $\\Omega(N,n)$ to be the number of ways of having $n$ spins up. This is just coin-flipping statistics, so \n",

Notice how at small $N$ the distribution isn't so perfect, but at larger $N$ it becomes more symmetric. Visually compare the shape of the entropy to the exact result, either from your notes, textbook, or from someone's lecture notes online."

    "Let's note a few things about this algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Instead of generating configurations uniformly and randomly and giving them a weight $e^{-H(C)/k_BT}$, we generate configurations with a probability $e^{-H(C)/k_BT}$, and weight them uniformly.\n",
    "2. That means that if want to compute something like the average energy $\\langle E \\rangle$, we simply run the algorithm for a whole bunch of Monte Carlo sweeps, and record the total energy occasionally, then compute its arithmetic mean. So if we take a total of $M$ samples of the energy: $\\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_{i=1}^M E_i$\n",
    "3. But how often should we sample the energy, or any other observable? Notice that the configurations that we generate in this manner are *correlated.* After we flip one spin, the configuration is almost the same as the last one. Even after we loop over all $N$ spins, it might still be very similar, depending on how \"easy\" it is to flip them.\n",
    "4. For this reason, we say that algorithms like MC generate a \"chain\" of configurations. In this case, the chain is \"Markovian,\" which means that each configuration only depends on the previous one. For that reason, we call this a \"Markov chain Monte Carlo\" (MCMC) algorithm.\n",
    "5. A good computational physicist will try to get a handle on such correlations and try to account for them when estimating error bars. More on this later.\n",
    "6. Notice that the initial config is random, and therefore doesn't look like a typical equilibrium config (except at infinite temperature). Therefore you have to discard some number of MC sweeps before recording data. There is no hard and fast rule for this --- it depends on the typical relaxation timescales in the system. \n",
    "7. Not all attempted \"moves\" are accepted. The ratio of successful to attempted moves is called the *acceptance ratio.* Clearly, there is some connection between the acceptance ratio and the efficiency of the algorithm (it should be neither too low nor too high), but again, there is no hard and fast rule for what it should be. What ultimately matters for the efficiency of a MC algorithm is the rate at which *uncorrelated* configurations (i.e., new informtation) are generated per unit *computer time.* \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's put the Metropolis algorithm to work on the Ising paramagnet in an external field. We will only have one parameter, which is $\\mu B/k_BT$, The code produces two plots:\n",
    "1. A plot of the energy of the system as a function of \"time\", i.e., MCS. I put \"time\" in inverted commas because there is no physical dynamics in this algorithm! \n",
    "2. A histogram of the energy. Note that this is a system coupled to a heat bath (ie, at constant temperature), and therefore the energy is not constant, it *fluctuates.* The distribution of energy is Gaussian, and the variance of the energy is related to the heat capacity via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (more on this below).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of things to play with/check out in this code!\n",
    "1. Look at how the energy fluctuates from one MCS to the next.\n",
    "2. Check out how these fluctuations are compiled into the histogram\n",
    "3. Try increasing/decreasing totMCS and note how the histo gets better/worse\n",
    "4. Try changing temperature/magnetic field. Think about what you expect to happen to the energy histo as you increase/decrease temp at fixed B, or vice versa. Should it shift left? Right?\n",
    "5. The code write the fraction of attemped spin flips that are successful. Think about what this number means for the numerical performance of the algorithm.\n",

To answer this, we have to think more pragmatically about the goals of molecular simulation. (This applies to all simulations, not just MC.)\n",

Rather, we want to *measure* something in the computer --- the average energy, or the magnetization, or the heat capacity. If you run a long MC simulation, compute the average energy, and report that number, you are not finished! This is because if you run the simulation again, you will get a different value for the average energy --- there is an error bar, that arises from finite sampling. If you gave me $M$ *independent* measurements (or estimates) of $\\langle E \\rangle$, then it is easy to compute the error bar: Just take the standard deviation of the estimates, and divide by the square root of $M-1$. This is called the \"standard error on the mean.\" It's a little confusing, so let me go through it step by step:\n",
    "1. Run a MC simulation and compute the average energy. Note that this is an *estimate* of $\\langle E \\rangle$. For that reason I will call it $\\bar{E}_i$. I give it an index since we will do this over and over.\n",

But now we return to the \"how long\" question, pointing out that over the course of a long MC simulation we should obtain independent samples, provided that we don't sample too frequently. How do we decide how many MC steps to discard between samples?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is provided by the correlation time --- after all, independent means uncorrelated. The procedure is therefore to measure the autocorrelation function, and determine the characteristic time $\\tau$ over which \"memory\" of previous configurations persists. If you sample configurations no more frequently than $tau$, you can reasonably expect them to be independent, and treat them as such in your error analysis. Below, we will show this for our paramagnet, but the results are boring. They are more interesting for the ferromagnet that you will study in the project 3.\n",

    "**Aside:** There is a more clever way to do this, reported in a J. Chem. Phys. article by Flyvbjerg and Petersen in 1989 (although they note that it is not their idea, they don't know where it came from, but they are reporting it for posterity). The basic idea is that if you compute the error from data that are sampled too frequently, you will underestimate errors --- variance will be lower, and $M$ is too big. However, in the regime where samples are independent, the error estimate is invariant under subsampling transformations. You should read this article if you work in computer simulation.\n"

    "## Phase transitions and the ferromagnet: A prelude\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic concept of a phase transition is familar from everyday life --- think of water freezing and melting, or boiling and condensing. We have the idea that there is somehow involved a transition from a more ordered state to a less ordered thermodynamic state, or vice versa. (There are also transitions between states of different crystal symmetry, but we will ignore them here.)\n",
    "\n",
    "How is a phase transition identified? One approach is to consider an *order parameter* which discriminates between the two phases. The order parameter for the liquid-vapor transition is the density --- the more dense phase is the liquid, the less dense phase the vapor. Recall from your thermo/stat mech that the boundary between the liquid and the vapor ends at a *critical point.* If you cross the boundary below the critical point, the density changes discontinuously. If you go right through the critical point, the density changes continuously as you go from vapor to fluid. The former is called a \"first order\" or dicontinuous phase transition, the latter a \"2nd order\" or \"continuous\" phase transition. At a first order phase transition, the derivative of free energy is discontinuous, while at a continuous transition it is continuous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether there exists a continuous transition (critical point, or line of critical points) between two phases is fundamentally related to the symmetry of the two phases. They must have the same symmetry in order for a critical point to exist (otherwise there is no way to continuously go from one to the other). \n",
    "\n",
    "The simple paramagnet that we have been studying so far is boring in this regard. Even though it is more or less ordered as $\\mu B/k_BT$ is varied, there is no phase transition that separates these regions. For that, we need to consider the ferromagnetic Ising model. The Hamiltonian is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H(C) = -\\mu B \\sum_{i=i}^N\\sigma_i - J\\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle} \\sigma_i\\sigma_j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The notation $\\langle i,j \\rangle$ means \"sum over nearest neighbors only.\" The ferromagnetic Ising model thus includes a coupling that tends to locally align the spins. Notice that the dimension now matters: On a one dimensional lattice of spins, each spin only has two neighbors, in 2D it has 4, and in 3D it has 6. \n",
    "\n",
    "The order parameter for the Ising model is the magnetisation per spin $m$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$m = \\frac{1}{N}\\mu\\sum_{i=i}^N\\sigma_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is positive when the spins are aligned to the field, and negative when they are on average antiparallel. In project 3, you will study the phase transitions in the ferromagnetic Ising model for $B = 0$ and $B \\neq 0$. When $B \\neq 0$, the system has a first-order transition --- as a function of temperature, there is a discontinuous jump in the magnetization as temperature is increased. At $B=0$, there is a critical point which occurs at a critical temperature $T_c = 2.269$. Above this temperature the system is disordered. Below $T_c$ the nearest neighbor interactions favor alignment of the spins. Since this happens in the absence of a magnetic field there is no difference anymore between up and down, and the system randomly selects a direction. This phenomenon is therefore called \"spontaneous symmetry breaking,\" since the up/down symmetry is broken in the absence of something (like a magnetic field) to pick a direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1st order transitions: Hysteresis** A system that has a 1st order transition will display *hysteresis.* This means that the transition occurs at different values of the control parameter ($T$ or $B$) in each direction (increasing or decreasing the control parameter). An example is shown in the figure:<img src=\"./hysteresis.jpg\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "At a first order transition, the low temperature phase appears first as \"droplets\" of a characteristic size --- we say that it is nucleated. Forming such a droplet requires paying the cost of the boundary (think of surface tension for a liquid droplet in vapor), and so you have to \"overshoot\" the phase boundary in order to form the phase. However, the exact way in which this happens is history-dependent, hence the name \"hysteresis.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**2nd order transitions: Scaling, critical exponents, and critical slowing down.** Second-order transitions are way more interesting. In contrast to 1st order transistions, at which a characteristic scale (droplet size) defines the length over which correlated fluctuations occur, at a 2nd order transition this lengthscale *diverges.* This behavior is captured by considering the correlation length $xi$, which measures the lengthscale over which a pair of spins are correlated:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\xi \\propto \\left| T - T_c\\right|^{-\\nu}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For the 2D Ising model, $\\nu=1$ The magnetization also diverges at the critical point. As the system is cooled through the critical temperature $T_c$ from below, the magnetization scales like:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$M \\propto \\left(T_c-T\\right)^{\\beta}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with $\\beta = 1/8$, obtained analytically by Onsager in the 50's. The response functions (heat capacity and magnetic susceptibility) also also diverge at the critical point, with their own exponents. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most remarkable discoveries in modern physics is the existence of *universality.* The exponents that describe the divergences at the critical point depend only on dimension, symmetry group of the Hamiltonian, and the range of the interaction (short or long). *Thus the Ising model (in 3D) and the van der Waal's fluid have the same exponents.* \n",
    "\n",
    "**Finite size and the thermodynamic limit.** In a finite system, nothing diverges, and simulations are always (very) finite. As you approach a critical point from above, the correlation length grows, but at some point it hits the edge of the simulatied lattice. I cannot grow without bound, and all divergences are \"rounded off.\" There is an extensive literature from the 80's (espcially David Landau, Bob Swendsen, Michael Fisher), but as a simple practical check one may simply compute response functions for systems of increasing size. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Aside: Periodic Boundary Conditions.* Speaking of which...what do we do about edge effects? By far the most common solution is to use periodic boundary conditions: The neighbors to the right of a spin on the far right edge are the first column on the left, etc. Note that this is still a finite system --- if the lattice is of size $L$, you cannot observe fluctuations with lengthscales longer than $L$. \n",
